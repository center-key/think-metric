   <ol>
      <li>Be sure the product is brightly lit</li>
      <li>Check that the product is in sharp focus</li>
      <li>Crop the image to draw attention to the product</li>
      <li>Increase the <b>"exposure"</b> and <b>"sharpness"</b> a bit to improve contrast</li>
      <li>Resize the image down to <b>1,200 pixels</b> of width (or height for portrait mode)</li>
      <li>Save (export) the image as a <code>.jpg</code> file
         (setting the compression level so the file size is just under <b>200 KB</b>)</li>
