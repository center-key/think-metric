      <h3>Go metric to boost your efficiency</h3>
      <p>
         It's challenging in the U.S. to get your hands on metric-only products.&nbsp;
         You mostly have to shop online, and unfortunately Amazon was the only e-commerce company
         that offered a variety of metric-only products.&nbsp;
         Walmart and Target have been expanding their online product selections, and now they do
         sell some metric-only products.
