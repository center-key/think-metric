         The best way to get others to switch to metric is to simply use metric yourself.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         While countries like Australia and New Zealand successfully metricated swiftly in the
         1970s by legislative order, such a top-down mandate is not politically viable for
         America.&nbsp;
         We are too large, too decentralized, and too rebellious.&nbsp;
         Instead, metrication is happening in America haphazardly centimeter by centimeter.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Today in the U.S. soft drinks are sold in <b>2L</b> bottles, running is measured in km,
         many popular guns are <b>9mm</b>, electrical usage is all metric, engine displacement is
         in liters plus

            class=external-site>car parts</a>
         are virtually all metric, nutrition and medicine are mostly labeled in <b>g, mg</b>, or
         <b>cc</b>.&nbsp;

      <p>
         The more we see metric in our daily lives and get accustom to the simplicity and coherency
         of metric, the faster America will fully metricate.&nbsp;
         <b>Today the low-key accidental superhero of making metric acceptable and even cool is
         SpaceX.</b>&nbsp;

      <h2>SpaceX Starship Launch 10</h2>
      <p>
         SpaceX rocket launches captivate the world's attention, and the breathtaking successful
         10th test launch of SpaceX Starship is a great time to highlight that the launch status
         console in SpaceX video feeds are all metric.&nbsp;
         Speed is displayed in km/h and altitude in km.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         SpaceX isn't on a public crusade to metricate America &mdash; they simply use metric and
         don't make a fuss about it.&nbsp;
         Because of SpaceX, Americans are now familiar with rockets in terms of <b>m, km, km/h,</b>
         and metric tons.&nbsp;

      <h2>#1 Metrication Advocate</h2>
      <p>
         NASA has historically felt public pressure to communicate in imperial units, but NASA's
         Launch Services Program (LSP) specifically does not mandate imperial units or metric units
         for launch vehicle providers.&nbsp;
         Nonetheless, SpaceX is normalizing metric, and making it inevitable that eventually all
         providers will both use and communicate in metric.&nbsp;

         As the most exciting company in the space industry and builder of the world's largest
         rocket ship in human history, SpaceX's public use of metric is enormously
         influential.&nbsp;

         <i>Think Metric</i> is proud to officially designate SpaceX as
         <b>The Unintentional #1 Metrication Advocate in America.</b>&nbsp;
         Congratulations SpaceX! &nbsp; 🏆
