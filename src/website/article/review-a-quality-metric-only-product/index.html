         Metric-only <a href={{webRoot}}/products>products</a> have cleaner more intuitive designs
         than equivalent dual-unit and imperial products.&nbsp;
         If you want to contribute to promoting metric-only products, take a few minutes to post a
         positive online review highlighting the good design of a quality metric-only product that
         you've purchased and enjoy.&nbsp;
      </p>

         An effective strategy is to highlight the simplicity, efficiency, and aesthetics of the
         product you're reviewing.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <div>
         <header>Consider phrases such as:</header>
         <ul>
            <li><i>"I love to cook, and switching to grams has removed a lot of measuring guesswork."</i></li>
            <li><i>"Saving a few seconds with each measurement is a nice productivity boost."</i></li>
            <li><i>"The Celsius gauge is uncluttered and looks great."</i></li>
            <li><i>"The streamlined design is quite stylish."</i></li>
            <li><i>"The scale on this tool is straightforward to use and eliminates annoying imperial fractions."</i></li>
         </ul>
      </div>

         Time is money, and you can help others save time by encouraging them to buy metric-only
         products.&nbsp;

      <h2>Dual-Units are Evil</h2>
      <figure class=medium-picture>
         <img src=dual-unit-scale.jpg alt=gauge data-license=fair-use>
         <figcaption>An ugly cluttered mess</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         Dual-units sound like the best of both worlds, but unfortunately having two disjoint
         numbers for a single measurement is
         <a href=https://ukma.org.uk/practical-help/home-diy/dual-measuring-tapes
            class=external-site>inconvenient and messy</a>.&nbsp;
         Dual-units literally harm intuition and learning.&nbsp;
         Numeracy is improved by keeping it clean and just using metric.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         For example, if a kid is trying to get good at estimating distances, jumping back and
         forth between km and miles will interfere with the kid developing a gut sense of either
         unit.&nbsp;
         Avoid unit conversions like the plague.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         A similar phenomena happens when learning a foreign language.&nbsp;
         You will never become fluent if you do not graduate beyond translating sentences word by
         word.&nbsp;
         Translating, whether for languages or measuring units, is an unnatural, awkward
         crutch.&nbsp;
