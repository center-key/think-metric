         Using only millimeters for length measurements on a large project has the advantage that
         you don't need to specify units because everyone on the project knows that all lengths
         will be communicated in "naked millimeters".&nbsp;
         Sticking exclusively to millimeters, especially in engineering and manufacturing, reduces
         ambiguity and saves time.&nbsp;
         Some call this practice the "Millimeter Standard" policy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         If your project or even entire business has made the decision to go "Millimeter Standard",
         that's awesome.&nbsp;
         However, "Millimeter Standard" in casual use can be rather cumbersome due to the
         unwieldy number of digits.&nbsp;
         When headed to the local garden center to buy 20 meters of irrigation tubing, you probably
         don't want to be burdened with a 5-digit number like 20,000.&nbsp;
      </p>

         Most people find meters and centimeters quite practical for everyday measurements and only
         use millimeters when working with very small items.&nbsp;
         On the other hand, if you prefer using millimeters for everything, go for it.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Beware of a small number of vocal pseudo-experts out there hell-bent on eradicating
         centimeters.&nbsp;
         They consider centimeters to be impure and unholy, but this stubbornness against
         convenience impedes metrication.&nbsp;
         Stay away from these pernicious crazies.&nbsp;

      <h2>Human Scale</h2>
      <p>
         A centimeter is the perfect precision for most "human scale" measurements.&nbsp;
         In contrast, the imperial inch is too clunky to measure something like your height, and
         that's why a person's imperial height is often given to the 1/2 inch.&nbsp;
         Millimeters have the opposite problem when used for human height as they lead to false
         precision and awkwardly large numbers.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Centimeters provide the correct level of precision and are super easy to
         communicate.&nbsp;
         To answer an inquiry about your height, you just need to reply with a simple number, such
         as 184, and you're done.&nbsp;
         Say 184 as "one eighty-four" and the person you are talking with is free to interpret that
         as 184 cm or 1.84 m depending on their needs.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         You can even use your body as a human ruler.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <table data-code-column=2 data-number-column=2>
         <thead><tr><th>Body Part</th><th>Ruler</th></tr></thead>
         <tbody>
            <tr><td>Across your pinky fingernail</td>                               <td>1 cm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Across your fist</td>                                           <td>10 cm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Ground to your belly button<br>(or hip line if you're tall)</td><td>100 cm</td></tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
         Long live the centimeter!&nbsp;

      <h2>Counterintuitive</h2>
      <p>
         Believe it or not, a regular metric tape measure is better for "Millimeter Standard"
         work than a specialized millimeter only tape measure.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <figure class=dark-mode-frame>
         <img src=green-tape-measure-10cm.jpg alt=10cm data-license=fair-use>
         <figcaption>Big, bold, high-contrast scale</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         If you are working on a project that is all millimeters, treat the numeric labels as the
         leading digits and the selected tick mark as the last digit.&nbsp;
         For example, a reading of <b>"7"</b> extended to the <b>3rd tick mark</b> means a
         measurement of <b>73 mm</b>.&nbsp;
         Rather than summing up two numbers, you're just gluing them together.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <table data-code-column=2 data-number-column=3>
         <thead><tr><th>Unit</th><th>Concatenation Example</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead>
         <tbody>
            <tr><td>mm</td><td>"7" + "3" + "mm" = "73mm"</td>       <td>73 mm</td></tr>
            <tr><td>cm</td><td>"7" + "." + "3" + "cm" = "7.3cm"</td><td>7.3 cm</td></tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
         This concatenation technique is cognitively faster because it involves no math.&nbsp;

         <figcaption>Specialized millimeter only tape measure scale with tiny digits</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         Specialized millimeter only tape measures are based on a fundamentally flawed design
         because the last digit of every numeric marker is always useless.&nbsp;
         The throwaway digit crowds the scale leading to reduced readability.&nbsp;
         Tiny digits are annoying and inefficient.&nbsp;
