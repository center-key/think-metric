         Metric is showing up in unexpected places.&nbsp;
         Major American sports broadcasters used to diligently convert international sport events
         from metric to imperial.&nbsp;
         More and more broadcasters are just reporting results directly in metric without any unit
         conversions.&nbsp;
         It's possible broadcasters are making deliberate decisions to go metric based on careful
         analysis.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         It's much more likely that the switch to metric for international sports is simply because
         it's less effort.&nbsp;
         Going metric is the <i>path of least resistance,</i> and this is a good thing.&nbsp;
         Actually, it is <b>THE</b> reason why the U.S. will eventually go full metric.&nbsp;

      <h2>It's Already Happening</h2>
      <p>
         If NASA made a deliberate decision today to give a press release using metric units the
         misguided imperial zealots would lose their collective minds.&nbsp;
         However, NASA scientists being interviewed on podcasts will often naturally use metric
         units and the imperial zealots don't come after them with pitchforks.&nbsp;
         Likewise, when a private space company, such as SpaceX, makes videos for the public in
         metric it's hard for there to be any significant backlash because SpaceX is a private
         company.&nbsp;

      </figure>
      <p>
         It won't be long before NASA can publish a press release in metric and nobody will have a
         psychological meltdown.&nbsp;
         We see a similar effect in online shopping.&nbsp;

      <h2>Consumer Space</h2>
      <p>
         Consumer goods in the U.S. are mostly imported, and online retailers rarely do proper
         conversions to fractional inches for product information.&nbsp;
         Converting units takes effort.&nbsp;
      </p>

         <figcaption>
            Customary fractional inches are just too much effort
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         Retailers are lazy so they convert product information to decimal inches or sometimes
         don't even bother.&nbsp;
         Who are the imperial zealots going to complain to?&nbsp;
         Americans see metric everyday.&nbsp;
      </p>

            How do you find 11.8-foot on a tape measure?&nbsp; Decimal feet are an abomination.

      <p>
         Journalists are underpaid and constantly pressured to produce more content.&nbsp;
         They don't have the luxury of spare time to do proper unit conversions, so they are
         increasingly doing quick and dirty conversions to imperial decimal units, such as decimal
         feet.&nbsp;
         For example, a journalist can save time by converting 3.8 m to 11.8 feet instead of doing
         the extra math to convert to the more customary 11 foot 10 inches.&nbsp;
         These makeshift unit conversions highlight how kludgy imperial units are and will
         contribute to swaying public opinion away from imperial.&nbsp;

   <section id=gradually>
      <h2>Cem by Cem</h2>
      <p>
         Everything that can be converted gradually will get fully converted to metric over
         time.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Some metrication cannot be done gradually.&nbsp;
         For example, aviation elevation in feet cannot be gradually converted to meters because
         mixing up units would literally cause airplanes to crash into the ground.&nbsp;
         Even countries that are fully metric, still use feet for elevation in aviation.&nbsp;
         However, the more common metric becomes, the easier it will be to metricate challenging
         domains like aviation.&nbsp;

   <section id=race>
      <h2>Race to the Bottom</h2>
      <p>
         Australia and New Zealand did metrication correctly by switching all at once from the top
         down.&nbsp;
         Here in America we are going to do it the hard way from the bottom up, but it will
         happen.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Metric is more efficient and sensible than imperial, so it's ironic that metrication
         in America will be a side-effect of the world-wide race to the bottom.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no "if" in metrication &mdash; only "when".
