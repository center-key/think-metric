         Writing down a fractional inch measurement on paper is trivial.&nbsp;
         The same is not true for interacting with a computer.&nbsp;
         Using fractions on websites is fraught with inconveniences.&nbsp;

         Fractions and computers mix like oil and water.

      <h2>Tedium of Extra Manual Steps</h2>
      <p>
         The <a href={{webRoot}}/calculator>kitchen calculator</a> on this website accepts
         both decimal and fractional imperial units, but the user interface is awkward and special
         instructions are needed.&nbsp;
         Without special instructions, users won't even know that fractions are allowed.&nbsp;
         This problem crops up in the computerized ordering system for closet doors at
         America's largest home improvement retailer.&nbsp;
         The problem then snowballs because the system automatically converts fractional inches to
         decimal inches, forcing customers to convert decimal inches back to fractions just to
         verify the correctness of an order.&nbsp;
         Even most imperial zealots don't have the fractional equivalent of
         <code title=5/8>0.625</code> committed to memory.&nbsp;
         Regardless, the fake precision of numbers like <code title=5/8>0.625</code>
         should offend all decent people.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Even when customers doesn't need to type out fractions, fractions still wreak havoc on
         product listings because computers will consider sizes like
         <code>3.5"</code>, <code>3 1/2"</code>, and <code>3 4/8"</code> to all be different sizes
         when in fact they are all identical.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Fractions also break sorting algorithms.&nbsp;
         Computers often consider <code>1/2</code> to be less then <code>3/16</code> because "1"
         comes before "3".&nbsp;
         Website search tools suffer a related problem.&nbsp;
         For example, the space character in <code>6 3/4"</code> tricks computers into thinking the
         user might be interested in 6-packs and <code>3/4"</code> drill bits, neither of which
         have anything at all to do with the measurement of <code>6 3/4"</code>.&nbsp;

      <p>
         Many of these problems could be mitigated if software developers were given infinite time
         to build perfect websites, but the reality is that dealing with fractions will never be a
         business priority.&nbsp;
         <b>Imperial fractions are a waste of money, and business operates on money.</b>&nbsp;
         That will never change.&nbsp;
         FULL&nbsp;STOP.&nbsp;
