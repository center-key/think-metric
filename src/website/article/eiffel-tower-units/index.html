         A frame of reference, such as the weight of an elephant or the length of a school bus,
         spices up storytelling.&nbsp;
         Authors incorporate frame of references to create interesting visualizations, and
         communication would be more bland without such tangible comparisons.&nbsp;

      <h2>Eiffel Tower Units are OK</h2>
      <p>
         When American news media company CNN reported on traveling over the Millau Viaduct, the
         reporter used the height of the Eiffel Tower as a reference.&nbsp;
         The fallback units were meters not feet, with the Eiffel Tower listed as 330 m.&nbsp;
         If CNN had been trying to avoid metric, the Eiffel Tower would have been listed as 1,083
         feet.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
         The take away for metrication advocates is that a frame of reference, such as the height
         of the Eiffel Tower, is not an attempt to avoid metric.&nbsp;
         On the contrary, showing the Eiffel Tower along with the metric measurement of 330 m
         helps create a memorable visualization and foster an intuitive sense of meters.&nbsp;
