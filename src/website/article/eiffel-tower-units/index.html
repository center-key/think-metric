         A frame of reference, such as the weight of an elephant or the length of a school bus,
         spices up storytelling.&nbsp;
         Authors incorporate frame of references to create interesting visualizations, and
         communication would be more bland without such tangible comparisons.&nbsp;

      <h2>Eiffel Tower Units are OK</h2>
      <p>
         When American news media company CNN reported on traveling over the Millau Viaduct, the
         reporter used the height of the Eiffel Tower as a reference.&nbsp;
         The fallback units were meters not feet, with the Eiffel Tower listed as 330 m.&nbsp;
         If CNN had been trying to avoid metric, the Eiffel Tower would have been listed as 1,083
         feet.&nbsp;

      <p>
         The take away for metrication advocates is that a frame of reference, such as the height
         of the Eiffel Tower, is not an attempt to avoid metric.&nbsp;
         On the contrary, showing the Eiffel Tower along with the metric measurement of 330 m
         helps create a memorable visualization and foster an intuitive sense of meters.&nbsp;

      <h2>"Olympic Swimming Pool" is a Metric Unit!</h2>
      <p>
         The <i>World Aquatics</i> federation defines the dimensions for Olympic swimming
         pools.&nbsp;
         An Olympic-sized swimming pool is <b>50 m</b> in length with a width of <b>25 m</b>.&nbsp;
         The pool must have a depth of at least <b>2 m</b>.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <blockquote class=equation-block>
         <code>
            1 Olympic swimming pool<br>
            = 50 m &times; 25 m &times; 2 m<br>
            = (50 &times; 25 &times; 2) m<sup>3</sup><br>
            = 2,500 cubic meters<br>
            = 2,500 tons of H<sub>2</sub>O
         </code>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         An Olympic swimming pool equals <b>2,500
         <a href=../a-pint-is-not-a-unit-of-measurement#ton>tons</a></b>.&nbsp;
         Obviously an Olympic swimming pool is not really a standard measuring unit.&nbsp;
         However, it's certainly more metric than imperial, and it can make a decent frame of
         reference.&nbsp;
