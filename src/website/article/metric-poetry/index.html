      <h3>Common words for SI</h3>
      <p>
         It's been said that metric is good for accuracy but imperial is better for poetry.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         You don't have to be a poet to see that's clearly an indictment of metric units being
         rather cumbersome when spoken.&nbsp;
         Nobody ever says, <i>"You missed by a kilometer"</i> or <i>"We're making progress
         centimeter by centimeter"</i>.&nbsp;
         Official metric units might sound graceful in say French, but they certainly don't in
         English.&nbsp;

         Colloquialism is essential for full metrication.&nbsp;
         It's time to shed some syllables and beautify these clumsy metric tongue twisters.&nbsp;

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <div>
         <ol>
            <li>
               These shortened common words are for casual spoken usage and make sense when written
               for song lyrics, novels, and screenplays.&nbsp;
               Regular text should still use correct metric units, like "5 km" and "20 ml".&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
               The word "mil" is overloaded.&nbsp;
               Since a "mil" can be either a millimeter or a milliliter, the meaning needs to be
               determined from context.&nbsp;
               A better word for millimeter would be "mim", but that ship has already sailed.&nbsp;
               No one is ever going to say that a GLOCK 19 (G19&nbsp;9&times;19mm) is a
               9&nbsp;mim.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
               Depending on context, kays can refer to kilometers as in
               <i>"It's a short hike of only 3 kays"</i>
               or to km/h as in
               <i>"There's a 40 kay speed limit near the school"</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
               It's best to stay away from the lesser known in-between unit terms, like
               hectometer, centiliter, or decagram, for the same reason you don't use archaic
               words that fell out of use a century ago.&nbsp;
               For example, it would be unnatural to say "3&nbsp;centiliters" instead of
               "30&nbsp;cc" or "30&nbsp;ml".&nbsp;
               Note that some unit terms that are generally obscure may in fact be commonly used in
               specific geographic regions, such as Germans saying "deka" to mean
               10&nbsp;g.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
               Avoid the Latin gibberish of the extreme prefixes except in scientific
               domains.&nbsp;
               For example, write "90,000 km" instead of "90 Mm".&nbsp; Or even use exponents, such
               as "3 &times; 10<sup>21</sup> m" instead of "3 Zm".&nbsp;
               A zettameter is Greek to everyone (except the Greeks).&nbsp;
               Seriously, exactly ZERO normal people are going to memorize even a quarter of this
               prefix gibberish:<br>

            </li>
            <li>
               Variety is the spice of life.&nbsp;
               In some regions people may prefer "klick" over "kay" for kilometer.&nbsp;
               Some may prefer "key" over "kilo" for kilogram.&nbsp;
               Local language variations are totally fine.&nbsp;

      <h2>Poetic</h2>
      <p>
         Trying to rhyme and rhythm with "centimeter" would paralyze even the greatest poet.&nbsp;
         On the other hand, "cem" pairs up nicely with a variety of other words, like gem, stem,
         them, item, hem, and mayhem.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>You may not be a poet of metric, but you know these easy common words are indeed
         electric.</i>
