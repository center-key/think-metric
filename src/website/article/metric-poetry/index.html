      <h3>Common words for SI</h3>
      <p>
         It's been said that metric is good for accuracy but imperial is better for poetry.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         You don't have to be a poet to see that's clearly an indictment of metric units being
         rather cumbersome when spoken.&nbsp;
         Nobody ever says, <b><i>"You missed by a kilometer"</i></b> or <b><i>"We're making
         progress centimeter by centimeter"</i></b>.&nbsp;
         And a <b><i>"kilogram-for-kilogram"</i></b> ranking is not going to happen.&nbsp;
         Official metric units might sound graceful in say French, but they certainly don't in
         English.&nbsp;

         Colloquialism is essential for full metrication.&nbsp;
         It's time to shed some syllables and beautify these clumsy metric tongue twisters.&nbsp;

      <h2>Table of Metric Common Words</h2>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <div>
         <ol>
            <li>
               These shortened common words are for casual spoken usage and make sense when written
               for song lyrics, novels, and screenplays.&nbsp;
               Regular text should still use correct metric units, like <b>"5 km"</b>
               and <b>"20 ml"</b>.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
               The word <b>"mil"</b> is overloaded.&nbsp;
               Since a <b>"mil"</b> can be either a millimeter or a milliliter, the meaning needs
               to be determined from context.&nbsp;
               A better word for millimeter would be <b>"mim"</b>, but that ship has already
               sailed.&nbsp;
               No one is ever going to say that a GLOCK 19 (G19&nbsp;9&times;19mm) is a
               <b>"9&nbsp;mim"</b>.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
               Depending on context, kays can refer to kilometers as in
               <b><i>"It's a short hike of only 3 kays"</i></b>
               or refer to km/h as in
               <b><i>"There's a 40 kay speed limit near the school"</i></b>.
            </li>
            <li>
               It's best to stay away from the lesser known in-between unit terms, like
               hectometer, centiliter, or decagram, for the same reason you don't use archaic
               words that fell out of use a century ago.&nbsp;
               For example, it would be unnatural to say <b>"3&nbsp;centiliters"</b> instead of
               <b>"30&nbsp;cc"</b> or <b>"30&nbsp;ml"</b>.&nbsp;
               Note that some unit terms that are generally obscure may in fact be commonly used in
               specific geographic regions, such as Germans saying <b>"deka"</b> to mean
               10&nbsp;g.&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
               Avoid the Latin gibberish of the extreme prefixes except in scientific
               domains.&nbsp;
               For example, write <b>"90,000 km"</b> instead of <b>"90 Mm"</b>.&nbsp;
               Or even use exponents, such as <b>"3 &times; 10<sup>21</sup> m"</b> instead
               of <b>"3 Zm"</b>.&nbsp;
               A zettameter is Greek to everyone (except the Greeks).&nbsp;
               Exactly ZERO normal people are going to memorize even a quarter of this
               prefix gibberish:<br>
               {% render 'src/templates/prefix-gibberish.html' %}
            </li>
            <li>
               Variety is the spice of life.&nbsp;
               In some regions people may prefer <b>"klick"</b> over <b>"kay"</b> for
               kilometer.&nbsp;
               Some may prefer <b>"key"</b> over <b>"kilo"</b> for kilogram.&nbsp;
               Local language variations are totally fine.&nbsp;

      <h2>Poetic</h2>
      <p>
         Trying to make rhythm by rhyming with <b>"centimeter"</b> would paralyze even the greatest
         poet.&nbsp;
         On the other hand, <b>"cem"</b> pairs up nicely with a variety of other words, like gem,
         stem, them, item, hem, and even mayhem.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>You may not be a poet of metric, but you know these easy common words are indeed
         electric.</i>
