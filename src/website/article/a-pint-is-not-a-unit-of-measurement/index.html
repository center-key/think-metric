         Someday in the future, the word "pint" will lose all meaning as a unit of
         measurement.&nbsp;
         A "pint" will simply mean <b>a glass of beer</b>.&nbsp;
         Saying "a pint of beer" will be as ridiculous as saying "a beer of beer."&nbsp;

         In other words, <b>ordering a pint at your local pub is perfectly fine in a
         metric world.</b>&nbsp;
         A pint is no more a unit of measurement than a glass.&nbsp;
         A glass of beer is generally about 500 ml, but it varies a lot just like a pint.&nbsp;
         A pint is not a unit of measurement.&nbsp;

         <blockquote>
            "People who wonder whether the glass is half empty or half full miss the point.&nbsp;
            The glass is refillable."

      <p>
         If a pint was used in British and Irish pubs as a form of measurement, we would hear some
         pub patrons place orders such as, <i>"I'd like <b>568 ml</b> of beer please"</i>.&nbsp;
         Of course nobody orders beer like that.&nbsp;
         A pint of beer in a pub is similar to a glass of milk at breakfast &mdash; it's used more
         as a descriptive object not a unit of measurement.&nbsp;

         Eventually there will only be a single meaning of the word "ton" for weight, and it will
         unambiguously mean exactly 1,000 kg.&nbsp;
         Today, unfortunately, we have the British ton (long ton), metric ton (tonne), and
         U.S. ton (short ton).&nbsp;
         Crazy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         The spelling of the word "tonne" is bizarre &mdash; that farcical word needs to die
         out.&nbsp;
         Saying "metric ton" solves the ambiguity problem, but it's redundant like
         saying "metric liter".&nbsp;
         Even if it takes 100 years, the ridiculous and inefficient jumble of ton units will be
         relegated to the dustbin of history, and a ton will just be a ton.&nbsp;
