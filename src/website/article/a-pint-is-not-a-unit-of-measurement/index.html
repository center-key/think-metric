      <p>
         Someday in the future, the word "pint" will lose all meaning as a unit of
         measurement.&nbsp;
         A "pint" will simply mean a glass of beer.&nbsp;
         Saying "a pint of beer" will be as ridiculous as saying "a beer of beer."&nbsp;
      </p>

         In other words, <b>ordering a pint at your local pub is perfectly fine in a
         metric world.</b>&nbsp;
         A pint is no more a unit of measurement than a glass.&nbsp;
         A glass of beer is generally about 500 ml, but it varies a lot just like a pint.&nbsp;
         A pint is not a unit of measurement.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         If you prefer your beer in a can, you can order a "tinnie" instead of a pint.&nbsp;

      <h2>It's Just a Ton</h2>

         Eventually there will only be a single meaning of the word "ton" for weight, and it will
         unambiguously mean exactly 1,000 kg.&nbsp;
         Today, unfortunately, we have the British ton (long ton), tonne (metric ton), and
         U.S. ton (short ton).&nbsp;
         Crazy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         The spelling of the word "tonne" is bizarre &mdash; the word needs to die out.&nbsp;
         Saying "metric ton" solves the ambiguity problem, but it's redundant like
         saying "metric liter".&nbsp;
         Even if it takes 100 years, the ridiculous and inefficient jumble of units will be
         relegated to the dustbin of history, and a ton will just be a ton.&nbsp;
