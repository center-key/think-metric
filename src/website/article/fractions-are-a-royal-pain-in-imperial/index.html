         What is a fifth of an imperial foot?&nbsp;
         Answering that question is going to require a bit of math.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Most likely the questioner expects the answer in inches, so we'll begin by
         multiplying by 12 to convert feet to inches.&nbsp;
         Below are all the steps to convert 1/5 foot into proper fractional inches.&nbsp;

         Metric is easier by a country klick.&nbsp;
         For example, there are 10 mm in a cm, so 1/5 of a cm is 2 mm.&nbsp;

         Some imperial zealots obsess about 1/3 because they incorrectly believe it makes them
         look smart.&nbsp;
         When they pull the 1/3 stunt, simply ask them what's 1/3 of a U.S. dollar?&nbsp;
         There's never been a world financial meltdown because someone couldn't do division on a
         dollar.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Answering the 1/3 question in metric is not a problem.&nbsp;
         Depending on the desired precision, the answer to what is 1/3 of a meter is either
         33 cm or 333 mm.&nbsp;
         Easy peasy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Even if you need to pull out a calculator, metric is still far less effort.&nbsp;
         Let's say your measurement is 1,267 mm.&nbsp;
         You punch in 1,267 and divide by 3, and you're done in one operation.&nbsp;
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
         The imperial equivalent is 49 7/8 inches, so you punch 7 into your calculator and divide
         by 8 then add 49 then hit equals and finally divide by 3.&nbsp;
         You get 16.63 inches, but sadly your tape measure does not have tick marks for 0.63 of an
         inch.&nbsp;
         <b>Doh!</b>&nbsp;
         What a royal pain for something so trivial.&nbsp;
