         What is a fifth of an imperial yard?&nbsp;
         Answering that question requires a bit of math.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Most likely the person asking the question expects the answer in familiar fractional
         inches where the fraction is some multiple of 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, or 1/32.&nbsp;
         Below are the simplest possible steps to convert 1/5 yard into proper fractional
         inches.&nbsp;

         Some imperial zealots obsess about 1/3 because they incorrectly believe that dividing by 3
         is incompatible with metric.&nbsp;
         When they pull the 1/3 stunt, simply ask them what's 1/3 of a cup?&nbsp;
      </p>

         While the imperial zealot is stewing over the awkwardness of 1/3 of cup, ask if they
         would have trouble figuring out 1/3 of a U.S. dollar?&nbsp;
         The U.S. dollar is metric and there's never been a world financial meltdown because
         someone couldn't do division on a dollar.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Answering the 1/3 question in metric is not a problem.&nbsp;
         Depending on the desired precision, the answer to what's 1/3 of a meter is either
         33 cm or 333 mm.&nbsp;
         Easy peasy.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Even if you need to pull out a calculator, metric is still far less effort.&nbsp;
         Let's say your measurement is 1,107 mm.&nbsp;
         You punch 1,107 into your calculator and divide by 3, and you're done in one
         operation.&nbsp;

      <p>
         The imperial equivalent is 43 5/8 inches, so you punch 5 into your calculator and divide
         by 8 then add 43 then hit equals and finally divide by 3.&nbsp;
         You get 14.54 inches, but sadly your tape measure does not have tick marks for 54/100 of
         an inch.&nbsp;

      <h2>The Proof Is in the Pudding</h2>
      <p>
         Fractions are such a pain in imperial that entire professions switched to
         incompatible "decimal" types of imperial units just to avoid imperial fractions.&nbsp;
         Land surveyors use decimal feet.&nbsp;
         Machinists use decimal inches.&nbsp;
         Meanwhile, carpenters use "customary" fractional inches.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
         The consequence of using imperial units is that surveyors, machinists, and carpenters
         cannot share each other's measurements.&nbsp;
         Surveyors and machinists do math every day, and they choose to avoid imperial fractions
         not because they are too dumb to do fractions but because they are smart and need to be
         efficient.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Time is money, and imperial is on the wrong side of the equation.&nbsp;

      <h2>Denominators are Sneaky</h2>
      <blockquote>
         How many inches is:<br>
         <code>(7 3/4" + 5 7/8") &times; 2</code>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         Doing basic math operations with fractional inches, is cumbersome, but denominators can be
         quite sneaky even if you're not doing math operations.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         How many times have you made a measurement like <code>9 5/16"</code> and then gone to make
         the cut only to have to return to measure again because you forgot if it was
         <code>9 5/8"</code> or <code>9 5/16"</code>?&nbsp;
      </p>

         <figcaption>Even Redditors cannot agree on which imperial denominator to use&nbsp; ðŸ¤£</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
         Because of the small extra cognitive load dedicated to remembering the denominators,
         you can hold fewer imperial measurements in your head simultaneously than metric
         measurements.&nbsp;
         Going metric means you have to write down measurements less often saving you a few seconds
         here and there so you're a bit more productive.&nbsp;
