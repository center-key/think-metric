      <h2>Don't be whiny</h2>
      <p>
         We advocate for metrication.&nbsp;
         Do not complain about obstacles and slow progress unless you also have ideas for
         solutions.&nbsp;
         Note that criticism and insults directed towards imperial units are just fine.&nbsp;

      <h2>America, Fuck Yeah</h2>
      <p>
         We do not tolerate whimpering and sniveling about Americans being too this or that to
         understand metric.&nbsp;
         Ain't nobody got time to listen to tankies, bootlickers, and jihadists cry about the
         U.S.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         NASA used metric for the Apollo flight calculations thus making America the one and only
         nation on earth to use metric to land a human on the moon.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <h2>No unit conversion tips</h2>
      <p>
         Doing unit conversions is like driving a rusted out Yugo or Trabant.&nbsp;
         Sure, you can do it, but why?&nbsp;
         Unit conversions hamper intuitive understanding of measurements and harm numeracy.&nbsp;
         Unit conversions are a distracting waste of time.&nbsp;

      <h2>Do not debate spelling or pronunciation</h2>
      <p>
         In America we spell and pronounce some metric words, like kilometer, differently than in
         other countries.&nbsp;
         That's fine &mdash; variety is the spice of life.&nbsp;
         Do not debate spelling and pronunciation.&nbsp;
         Being pedantic and annoying makes all metric advocates seem like dweeby jerks.&nbsp;

      <p>
         The same goes for spaces and commas.&nbsp;
         Official science and engineering documents should put a space between the numerical
         value and unit symbol in order to consistently adher to SI rules.&nbsp;
         In casual writing, however, dropping the space often looks better and is perfectly
         acceptable.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Also, we Americans use a comma as the thousands separator, and this is great for clarity.&nbsp;
         1 234 is confusing and causes formatting errors.&nbsp;
         1,234 is clear.&nbsp;

      <h2>Don't be pedantic</h2>
      <p>
         Following SI (International System of Units) rules correctly is important in professional
         domains such as scholarly publishing, engineering specifications, government regulations,
         and business contracts.&nbsp;
         However, SI rules are not helpful when casually communicating about things like your
         height and weight.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         We support metrication, and adherence to the finer details of SI rules is a separate
         discussion from metrication.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <h2>Don't lie about elephants being imperial units</h2>
      <p>
      <figure>
         <img src=asian-elephant.jpg data-author=basile-morin-on-wikimedia data-license=cc-by-sa alt=elephant>

      <p>
         A frame of reference, such as an elephant or a school bus, spices up
         storytelling.&nbsp;
         Authors incorporate frames of reference to create interesting visualizations, and
         communication would be more dull without them.&nbsp;
         An elephant is neither imperial nor metric, so don't claim that a frame of reference is a
         way to avoid metric.&nbsp;

      <h2>Metric clock gibberish is prohibited</h2>
      <p>
         Metric clocks are a goofy idea that have nothing to do with metrication.&nbsp;
         A tenth of a day is a useless time interval, so the whole idea of a metric clock can
         never catch on.&nbsp;
         The base SI unit for time is the second, and the other units of time, like minute and hour, are
         just convenient derivations of the second.&nbsp;
