         A small but simple way to advance metrication is to communicate using metric units.&nbsp;
         The more our fellow Americans are exposed to metric, the sooner we will all gain an
         intuitive sense of metric.&nbsp;

         As the saying goes, <i>"A picture is worth a thousand words"</i> (not 5,280 words but
         1,000).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         You can leverage the power of a picture by taking a photo of a product you love that you
         purchased online.&nbsp;
         Take the photo while the product is being measured with a metric-only ruler or scale, and
         include the photo in a review of the product you submit to the online shopping
         website.&nbsp;

      <h2>Visual Reference</h2>

      <p>
         The visual reference in your product review will help other shoppers by providing
         measurement information, and it will also give everyone a frame of reference for visually
         understanding metric units.&nbsp;
         For example, a great way to learn that an almond is about 3 cm long is to see a photo of
         a centimeter ruler measuring the very type of almond you're just about to put in your
         shopping cart.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Whenever you stumble upon a helpful product review that shows a metric reference, be sure
         to smash that <i>"Helpful"</i> button.
