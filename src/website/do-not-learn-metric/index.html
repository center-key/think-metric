         You don't need to <i>"learn"</i> metric &mdash; <b>just use it.</b>&nbsp;
         When you were a kid your parents took you to the grocery store and you put a gallon of milk in the shopping cart.&nbsp;
         And today you know what a gallon is even if it was never explicitly taught to you.&nbsp;
         Likewise, you know your own height and weight because you measure yourself.&nbsp;
         Nobody had to teach you how to step onto a bathroom scale.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>AFTER</b> you are familiar with using metric, you can learn about prefixes, base units, and orders of magnitude.&nbsp;
         The metric system is based on a coherent set of principles enabling measuring units to integrate in a logical manner, but you do not need to know that to start your metric journey.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Many people are reluctant to switch to metric due to concern it will cause mental mayhem.&nbsp;
         It's actually not too difficult.&nbsp;
         After switching over to Celsius for a week you'll likely have a good intuitive sense of Celsius.&nbsp;

         If you get a metric only tape measure and switch over to using metric for your home projects, you'll quickly realize that millimeters are awesome.&nbsp;
         The mm is the perfect size.&nbsp;
         A mm is the smallest length you can reliably measure quickly without special tools and extra lighting.&nbsp;
         Metric literally requires less effort to remember your measurements and helps you quickly cut accurately.&nbsp;

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div>
         <ol>
            <li><b>Settings</b> &mdash; Set your mobile device to metric.&nbsp; Set your refrigerator, home thermostat, and car temperature to Celsius.&nbsp; Set the scales in your kitchen and bathroom to display grams and kilograms.</li>
            <li><b>Tools</b> &mdash; Buy some <a href={{webRoot}}/products>metric only measuring devices</a> (avoid dual units like the plague because dual units kill your senses).&nbsp; Sadly, you'll have to purchase online as retail stores mostly sell imperial.</li>
            <li><b>Communication</b> &mdash; When talking with other people use metric as if everyone normally uses metric.&nbsp; When you get a puzzled look, just casually provide a frame of reference or gesture a size with your hands.</li>
         </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
         Do not do unit conversions.

         After using metric for a while, you'll realize that the inconveniences you encounter being in an imperial world are pretty much the same as before.&nbsp;
         Imperial and metric share one important trait &mdash; they are both incompatible with imperial.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Every once in a while you'll encounter something like a product page on Amazon where the manufacture or reseller
         <a href={{webRoot}}/article/metrication-is-the-path-of-least-resistance>didn't bother</a>
         to convert to imperial.&nbsp;
         The product information will be all metric.&nbsp;

         <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b><br>
         "Nothing to learn" only applies to casual everyday metric usage.&nbsp;
         Metric in science, engineering, medicine, publishing, legal, and other professional domains definitely requires knowing the rules of SI (International System of Units).&nbsp;
