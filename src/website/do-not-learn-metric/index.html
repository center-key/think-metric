         You don't need to <i>"learn"</i> metric &mdash; <b>just use it.</b>&nbsp;
         When you were a kid your parents took you to the grocery store and you put a gallon of
         milk in the shopping cart.&nbsp;
         And today you know what a gallon is even if it was never explicitly taught to you.&nbsp;
         Likewise, you know your own height and weight because you measure yourself.&nbsp;
         Nobody had to teach you how to step onto a bathroom scale.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>AFTER</b> you are familiar with using metric, you can learn about prefixes, base units,
         and orders of magnitude.&nbsp;
         The metric system is based on a coherent set of principles enabling measuring units to
         integrate in a logical manner, but you do not need to know that to start your metric
         journey.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Many people are reluctant to switch to metric due to concern it will cause mental
         mayhem.&nbsp;
         It's actually not too difficult.&nbsp;
         For example, after switching over to Celsius for a week you'll likely have a good
         intuitive sense of Celsius.&nbsp;
         It's not rocket science.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
         If you get a metric-only tape measure and switch over to using metric for your home
         projects, you'll quickly realize that millimeters are awesome.&nbsp;
         The mm is the perfect size.&nbsp;
         A mm is the smallest length you can reliably measure quickly without special tools and
         extra lighting.&nbsp;
         Metric literally requires less effort to remember your measurements and helps you quickly
         cut accurately.&nbsp;

               Set your refrigerator, home thermostat, and car temperature to Celsius.&nbsp;
               Set the scales in your kitchen and bathroom to display grams and kilograms.&nbsp;

            <li>
               <b>Tools</b> &mdash;
               Buy some

               (avoid dual units like the plague because dual units kills intuition).&nbsp;
               Sadly, you'll have to purchase online as retail stores mostly sell imperial.&nbsp;

               <b>Communication</b> &mdash;
               When talking with other people use metric as if everyone normally uses metric.&nbsp;
               When you get a puzzled look, just casually provide a frame of reference or gesture a
               size with your hands.&nbsp;

      <h2>Imperial World</h2>
      <p>
         After using metric for a while, you'll realize that the inconveniences you encounter
         being in an imperial world are pretty much the same as before.&nbsp;
         Imperial and metric share one important trait &mdash; they are both incompatible with
         imperial.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         Every once in a while you'll even encounter something like a product page on an online
         store where the manufacture or reseller
         <a href={{webRoot}}/article/metrication-is-the-path-of-least-resistance>didn't bother</a>
         to convert to imperial.&nbsp;
         The product information will be all metric.&nbsp;
      </p>

         For the times you are out shopping and need a specific length of product, take along a
         handy <a href={{webRoot}}/products/#tape-measures>pocket tape measure</a>.&nbsp;
         These small devices are perfect on trips to the hardware store for quick measurements for
         DIY projects.&nbsp;

      <h2>IMPORTANT NOTE</h2>
      <p>
         "Nothing to learn" only applies to casual everyday metric usage.&nbsp;
         Metric in science, engineering, medicine, publishing, legal, and other professional
         domains definitely requires knowing the rules of SI (International System of Units).&nbsp;
